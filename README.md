# Applied-Inferential-Statistics-Project
This project applies inferential statistics to real-world problems—evaluating stone for printing, testing fitness program results, and analyzing implant hardness—to drive sharper insights and better decisions.

This project applies inferential statistics to solve three real-world problems across different industries. Using data analysis and hypothesis testing, it explores:

Stone suitability for printing

Effectiveness of a fitness program

Impact of dentists and implant methods on metal implant hardness

The insights aim to support data-driven decision-making and improve operational efficiency.
